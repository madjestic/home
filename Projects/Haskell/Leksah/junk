 9 Work out how to change the GtkSourceView bindings (this might be difficult)
10 03:06 < hamishmack> or you could add to the TextEditor and SourceBuffer modules in Leksah the
11                     commands you want to bind
12 03:07 < hamishmack> (assuming they are not already there)
13 03:09 < hamishmack> Those modules are this one… 
14                     https://github.com/leksah/leksah/blob/master/src/IDE/TextEditor.hs (which trie
15                     to abstract the differences between Yi and GtkSourceView)
16 03:09 < hamishmack> And this one… 
17                     https://github.com/leksah/leksah/blob/master/src/IDE/Pane/SourceBuffer.hs

Here is how to build the latest Leksah from git… 
                    https://github.com/leksah/leksah/blob/master/.travis.yml
03:17 < hamishmack> We chose git becuase it currently has better tools (SmartGit and github)
03:18 < hamishmack> Here is the output of travis for that build script…
03:18 < hamishmack> https://travis-ci.org/leksah/leksah
03:19 < hamishmack> you don't have to install travis or anything.  It is just handy for checking 
                    that things build.

03:21 < hamishmack> Once you have done the "cabal-meta install -fgtk3 --force-reinstalls" step (the 
                    last one)
03:22 < hamishmack> you should be able to run leksah and do Package -> Add to add the leksah.cabal
03:23 < hamishmack> Then you can rebuild leksah in leksah

04:09 < hamishmack> Oh there is one other module in the chain
04:09 < hamishmack> IDE.Command
04:11 < madjestic> ok, but is my logic correct, or is that totally wrong?
04:11 < hamishmack> So in there it defined commands that can be in the keymap.lkshk file
04:11 < madjestic> ah
04:14 < madjestic> that makes sense
04:19 < madjestic> I don't think I see a command in IDE/Command.hs, related to the end of line

/home/madjestic/.leksah-0.13/packageSources/leksah-0.12.1.3/data/keymap.lkshk
